 * The M2C, M2J and M2Sharp compilers are multi-dialect Modula-2 translators
 * and compilers respectively targeting C99, Java/JVM and C#/CLR, sharing a
 * common abstract syntax tree (AST) specification.
 *
 * The AST node diagram generator script collection consists of Graphviz DOT
 * descriptions for all AST node types of the common AST specification.
 *
 * The Graphviz dot utility is required to generate the diagrams. 
 * It may be obtained from http://www.graphviz.org/download.php.
